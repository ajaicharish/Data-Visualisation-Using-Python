Dataset:Term Deposits Optimal Marketting Targets
Term deposits constitute an important source of revenue for banks, with telephonic marketing being one of the most effective methods of promoting them. Nevertheless, such campaigns are resource-intensive, often requiring large-scale call center operations. To enhance efficiency, it is critical to identify customers with a higher probability of subscription prior to engagement. This dataset originates from direct telemarketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank and is intended to support the prediction of customer subscription to a term deposit (yes/no).
I have used the dataset to analyse the data and to visualise each of the coloumns against the subscription pattern
